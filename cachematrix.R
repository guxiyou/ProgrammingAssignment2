## Set of functions used to save a matrix, calculate it's
## inverse and then, on subsequent calls, return the cached
## inverse matrix

## makeCacheMatrix: stores initial matrix and cached inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve: returns the inverse matrix of a given cacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
